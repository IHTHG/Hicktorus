Hicktorus is a minecraft resource pack that i plan to update and learn how to make packs through.
the ui and bace armors are not originaly mine, and i do not claim ownership of. however, the swords and all non-venilla tools.
there are some items that you need CIT to find.
CIT allows me to change the textures of items or even add custom models.
you get these special re-textures from renaiming them in an anvil.
